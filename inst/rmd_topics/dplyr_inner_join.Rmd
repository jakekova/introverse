```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,

## Description

The [`inner_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/inner_join.html) function is part of the [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

The `inner_join()` function merges _two relational datasets_ to retain only information that is shared by _both_ tibbles (data frames). Specifically, `inner_join()` retains only rows that are present in _both_ the left and right tibbles (data frames):


```{r tidyexplain, echo=F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../tidyexplain_gifs/inner-join.gif")
```


<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
To use this function, you need to either first load the `{dplyr}` library, or always use the function with `dplyr::inner_join()` notation.

```{r description, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(dplyr)
# Or, load the full tidyverse:
library(tidyverse)

# Or, use :: notation
dplyr::inner_join()
```


## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
inner_join(left tibble, right tibble)
# is equivalent to:
inner_join(right tibble, left tibble)


# or with piping:
left tibble %>%
  inner_join(right tibble)
# is equivalent to:
right tibble %>%
  inner_join(left tibble)
```

## Examples

Consider the following example datasets, These two tibbles have column names `name` and `vore` in common. They both contain rows for "Dog", "Pig", and "Rabbit", but `first_tibble` also contains "Tiger" and `second_tibble` also contains "Sheep".

```{r show_example_data, collapse=TRUE}
first_tibble

second_tibble
```

<br>


```{r example1}
# inner_join first_tibble and second_tibble
# Left/right order does not matter except to determine final column order
first_tibble %>%
  inner_join(second_tibble)
```

<br>

```{r example2}
# inner_join first_tibble and second_tibble
# Left/right order does not matter except to determine final column order
second_tibble %>%
  inner_join(first_tibble)
```
