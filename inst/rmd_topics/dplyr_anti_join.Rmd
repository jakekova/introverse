## Description

The [`anti_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/anti_join.html) function is part of the [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

The `anti_join()` function merges _two relational datasets_ to retain only information that is not shared between them. In order to merge relational datasets, there must be at least one column name in common.

Specifically, `anti_join()` retains all rows from the left tibble (data frame) which are not present in the right tibble (data frame):


```{r tidyexplain, echo=F, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../tidyexplain_gifs/anti-join.gif")
```


<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
To use this function, you need to either first load the `{dplyr}` library, or always use the function with `dplyr::anti_join()` notation.

```{r description, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(dplyr)
# Or, load the full tidyverse:
library(tidyverse)

# Or, use :: notation
dplyr::anti_join()
```


## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
anti_join(left tibble, right tibble)

# or with piping:
left tibble %>%
  anti_join(right tibble)
```

## Examples

Consider the following example datasets, These two tibbles have column names `name` and `vore` in common. They both contain rows for "Dog", "Pig", and "Rabbit", but `first_tibble` also contains "Tiger" and `second_tibble` also contains "Sheep".

```{r show_example_data, collapse=TRUE}
first_tibble

second_tibble
```

<br>


```{r example1}
# anti_join with first_tibble on the left and second_tibble on the right
first_tibble %>%
  anti_join(second_tibble)
```

<br>

```{r example2}
# anti_join with second_tibble on the left and first_tibble on the right
second_tibble %>%
  anti_join(first_tibble)
```
